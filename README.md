# Face-detection
This Python script uses OpenCV to perform real-time face detection via webcam. It loads a Haar cascade to detect faces in each video frame. Frames are resized and converted to grayscale for faster processing. Detected faces are highlighted with green rectangles, and FPS is displayed. Press 'q' to exit the video stream and close the window.
